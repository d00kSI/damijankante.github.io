## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm or Yarn (npm is used in instructions)
*   Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/damijankante/damijankante.github.io.git
    cd damijankante.github.io
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables (for Contact Form):**
    The contact form uses EmailJS. You'll need to create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add your EmailJS API keys:

    ```dotenv
    VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_emailjs_service_id
    VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_emailjs_template_id
    VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_emailjs_public_key
    ```
    (Replace `your_..._id` with your actual keys from [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/).)

4.  **Organize Your Assets:**
    Place your project cover images and gallery images in the following structured directories:
    ```
    src/assets/images/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ covers/                  # For main project cover images
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ graphic-magazine-design.png
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ coding-portfolio.png
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data-sales-dashboard.png
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (match filenames to project IDs)
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ galleries/               # For project gallery images (subfolders per project ID)
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ graphic-magazine-design/
        ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01-page-spread.jpg
        ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02-another-view.png
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (numbered for order)
        ‚îÇ
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ coding-portfolio/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01-homepage.jpg
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ```

5.  **Setup Favicons & Social Preview Image:**
    *   Place all generated favicon files (from [RealFaviconGenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)) directly into the `public/` directory.
    *   Place your social media preview image (`social-preview.jpg` or `.png`, recommended 1200x630px) into the `public/` directory as well.
    *   Ensure `public/index.html` has the correct `href` attributes for these (absolute URLs pointing to your live domain, e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/social-preview.jpg`).

### Local Development

```bash
npm run dev
# or yarn dev
